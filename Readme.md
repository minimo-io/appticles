# About appticles

A bunch of mini-apps or appticles created for [minimo.io](https://minimo.io).

These micro-apps were embedded on blog posts for adding extra functionality. They were developed primarily using the Svelte Framework or Alpine.js. Most of them just as proof-of-concepts and for learning purposes.

The site [minimo.io](https://github.com/minimo-io/minimo-11ty) itself was built using [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy).
